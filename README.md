# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning


This repository contains a step-by-step machine learning project for predicting diabetes (binary classification) using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. The goal is to provide a reproducible, well-documented pipeline suitable for a GitHub portfolio.


## Project highlights
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Data cleaning & preprocessing (handling zero / missing values, scaling)
- Model training and comparison: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix
- Notebook + modularized scripts for reproducibility
